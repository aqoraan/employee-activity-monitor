## Configuration

### USB Blocking Configuration

Edit `config.json` to enable USB blocking:

```json
{
  "usbBlockingSettings": {
    "enableUsbBlocking": true,
    "googleSheetsApiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "googleSheetsSpreadsheetId": "YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID",
    "googleSheetsRange": "A:A",
    "cacheExpirationMinutes": 5,
    "blockAllUsbStorage": false,
    "allowWhitelistedOnly": true,
    "logBlockedDevices": true,
    "sendBlockingAlerts": true,
    "localWhitelist": [
      "USB\\VID_0951&PID_1666",
      "USB\\VID_0781&PID_5567"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Google Sheets Whitelist Format

Create a Google Sheet with the following structure:

| Column A | Column B | Column C |
|----------|----------|----------|
| **Device ID** | **Description** | **Approved By** |
| USB\VID_0951&PID_1666 | Kingston DataTraveler | admin@company.com |
| USB\VID_0781&PID_5567 | SanDisk Cruzer | admin@company.com |

## Activity Types and Severity

| Activity Type | Description | Default Severity |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| **UsbDrive** | USB device connection/disconnection | Medium |
| **UsbBlocked** | Unauthorized USB device blocked | High |
| **FileTransfer** | File operations on external drives | Medium |
| **AppInstallation** | Software installation detected | Medium |
| **BlacklistedApp** | Prohibited application detected | High |
| **NetworkActivity** | Suspicious network connections | Medium |
| **System** | System-level events and errors | Variable |

### Severity Levels

- **Low**: Minor activities, informational only
- **Medium**: Standard monitoring events
- **High**: Security concerns requiring attention
- **Critical**: Immediate security threats

## N8N Integration

### Workflow Overview

The N8N workflow processes incoming webhook data and sends email alerts:

1. **Webhook Trigger**: Receives activity data from the monitoring application
2. **Data Processing**: Extracts and formats activity information
3. **Severity Filtering**: Routes alerts based on severity level
4. **Email Sending**: Sends alerts to appropriate recipients
5. **Response**: Confirms successful processing

### USB Blocking Alerts

Special handling for USB blocking events:
- **High Priority**: USB blocking events trigger immediate alerts
- **Detailed Information**: Includes device ID, reason, and timestamp
- **Security Warnings**: Clear indication of security incident
- **Action Required**: Prompts for immediate investigation

### Email Configuration

Update the email settings in the N8N workflow:

```json
{
  "fromEmail": "security@yourcompany.com",
  "toEmail": "admin@yourcompany.com"
}
```

   - Check configuration file syntax

2. **N8N Integration Issues**
   - Verify N8N is running
   - Check webhook URL configuration
   - Test network connectivity
   - Review N8N workflow logs

## Compliance and Best Practices

### Privacy Considerations
- **Employee Notification**: Inform employees about monitoring activities
- **Data Retention**: Implement appropriate data retention policies
